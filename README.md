# Recursion and Iteration #

Repetion can be implemented with recursion and iteration. Lets first look at simply computing the factorial of 4.

``` python
import math

print(math.factorial(4))
```
```
24
```
The result is `1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24`.

To implement our own factorial function we can use iteration, a for-loop or while-loop, like so:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(factorial(4))
```
```
24
```

or we can use recursion, a function that calls itself. Then we also need a stop condition to prevent the function from calling itself indefinitely, like so:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:  # stop condition
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # function calling itself
print(factorial(4))
```
```
24
```

We can evaluate this as:
```
factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3)
             = 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
             = 24
```

To better understand what is going on when we run the program we can use invocation_tree:

```python
import invocation_tree as ivt

def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

tree = ivt.blocking()  # block and wait for <Enter> key press
tree(factorial, 4)     # call function 'factorial' with argument '4' 
```

to graph the function invocations. Press &lt;Enter&gt; to walk through each step of the repetition until the stop condition is met.

![factorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/main/images/factorial.gif)

Or see it in the [Invocation Tree Web Debugger](https://www.invocation-tree.com/#codeurl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/refs/heads/main/src/factorial.py).

Each node in the invocation tree represents a function call, and the node's color indicates its state:

 - White: The function is currently being executed.
 - Green: The function is paused and will resume execution later.
 - Red: The function has completed execution and has returned.

For every function call, the package displays its **local variables** and **return value**. Changes to the values of these variables over time are highlighted using bold text and gray shading to make them easier to track.

In some functional and logical programming languages (e.g. Haskell, Prolog) there are not loops so there 2is only recursion to implement repetition, but in Python we have a choice between recursion and iteration. Generally iteration is the default choice in Python as it is often faster and many find it easier to understand. However, in some situation recursion comes with great benefits so it's important to master both ways of implemention repetition.

# Permutations #

We can use recursion to compute all permutation of a number of elements with replacement, meaning each element can be used any number of times. All permutations of length 3 of elements 'L' and 'R' can be made by moving down a tree for 3 steps and going first Left and then Right in a depth-first manner:

![perms_LR3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/main/images/perms_LR3.png)

This can be implemented recursively like:

```python
import invocation_tree as ivt

def permutations(elements, perm, n):
    if n == 0:       # stop condition, check if all steps are used up
        print(perm)
    else:
        for element in elements:                         # for each element
            permutations(elements, perm + element, n-1)  #   add it and do next step

tree = ivt.gif('permutations.png')
tree(permutations, 'LR', '', 3)  # permutations of L and R of length 3
```
```
LLL
LLR
LRL
LRR
RLL
RLR
RRL
RRR
```
![permutations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/main/images/permutations.gif)
Or see it in the [Invocation Tree Web Debugger](https://invocation-tree.com/#timestep=1.0&play)

The visualization shows the depth-first nature of recursion. Each time the first elements is chosen first, and quickly the bottom of the tree is reached. Then one step back is made, and the next element is chosen. When each element had it's turn, another step back is made. This pattern repeats until all permutations are printed.

We can also iterate over all permutations with replacement using the `product()` function of `iterools` to get the same result:

```python
import itertools as it

for perm in it.product('LR', repeat = 3):
    print(perm)
```

# Recussion Benefit #

The benefit recursion brings is that we have more control over which permutations are generated. For example if we don't want neighboring elements to be equal we could simply write:

```python
import invocation_tree as ivt

def permutations(elems, perm, n):
    if n == 0:
        print(perm)
    else:
        for element in elems:
            if len(perm) == 0 or not perm[-1] == element:  # test neighbor
                permutations(elems, perm + element, n-1)  

tree = ivt.blocking()
tree(permutations, 'ABC', '', 3)  # permutations of A, B, C of length 3
```
```
ABA
ABC
ACA
ACB
BAB
BAC
BCA
BCB
CAB
CAC
CBA
CBC
```
![permutations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/main/images/permutations_neighbor.gif)
Or see it in the [Invocation Tree Web Debugger](https://www.invocation-tree.com/#codeurl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bterwijn/invocation_tree/refs/heads/main/src/permutations_neighbor.py)

This stops neighbors from being equal early, in contrast to iteration, where we would have had to filter permutation with equal neighbors out after the fact which could be much slower.

**exercise1:** Print all permutations with replacements of elements 'A', 'B', and 'C' of length 5 that are palindrome ('ABABA' is palindrome because if you read it backwards it's the same).

## Path Planning ##


## Blocking ##
The program blocks execution at every function call and return statement, printing the current location in the source code. Press the &lt;Enter&gt; key to continue execution. To block at every line of the program (like in a debugger tool) and only where a change of value occured, use instead:

```python
    tree = ivt.blocking_each_change()
```

# Debugger #
To visualize the invocation tree in a debugger tool, such as the integrated debugger in Visual Studio Code, use instead:

```python
    tree = ivt.debugger()
```

and open the 'tree.pdf' file manually.

## Hidding ##
It can be useful to hide certian variables or functions to avoid unnecessary complexity. This can for example be done with:

```python
tree = ivt.blocking()
tree.hide_vars.add('permutations.elements')
tree.hide_vars.add('permutations.element')
tree.hide_vars.add('permutations.all_perms')
```

Or hide certain function calls:

```python
tree = ivt.blocking()
tree.hide_calls.add('namespace.functionname')
```

Or ignore certain function calls so that all it's children are hidden too:

```python
tree = ivt.blocking()
tree.ignore_calls.add('namespace.functionname')
```

# Configuration #
These invocation_tree configurations are available for an `Invocation_Tree` objects:

```python
tree = ivt.Invocation_Tree()
```

- **tree.filename** : str  
  - filename to save the tree to, defaults to 'tree.pdf'
- **tree.show** : bool
  - if `True` the default application is open to view 'tree.filename'
- **tree.block** :  bool
  - if `True` program execution is blocked after the tree is saved
- **tree.src_loc** : bool
  - if `True` the source location is printed when blocking
- **tree.each_line** : bool
  - if `True` each line of the program is stepped through
- **tree.max_string_len** : int
  - the maximum string length, only the end is shown of longer strings 
- **tree.gifcount** : int
  - if `>=0` the out filename is numbered for animated gif making
- **tree.indent** : string
  - the string used for identing the local variables
- **tree.color_active** : string
  - HTML color for active function 
- **tree.color_paused*** : string
  - HTML color for paused functions
- **tree.color_returned***: string
  - HTML color for returned functions
- **tree.hide** : set()
  - set of all variables names that are not shown in the tree
- **tree.to_string** : dict[str, fun]
  - mapping from type/name to a to_string() function for custom printing of values

For convenience we provide these functions to set common configurations:

- **ivt.blocking(filename)**, blocks on function call and return
- **ivt.blocking_each_change(filename)**, blocks on each change of value
- **ivt.debugger(filename)**, non-blocking for use in debugger tool (open &lt;filename&gt; manually)
- **ivt.gif(filename)**, generates many output files on function call and return for gif creation
- **ivt.gif_each_change(filename)**, generates many output files on each change of value for gif creation
- **ivt.non_blocking(filename)**, non-blocking on each function call and return

# Troubleshooting #
- Adobe Acrobat Reader [doesn't refresh a PDF file](https://community.adobe.com/t5/acrobat-reader-discussions/reload-refresh-pdfs/td-p/9632292) when it changes on disk and blocks updates which results in an `Could not open 'somefile.pdf' for writing : Permission denied` error. One solution is to install a PDF reader that does refresh ([SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/), [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/),  ...) and set it as the default PDF reader. Another solution is to `render()` the graph to a different output format and to open it manually.
